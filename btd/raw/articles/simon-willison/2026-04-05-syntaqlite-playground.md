<p><strong>Tool:</strong> <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/syntaqlite">Syntaqlite Playground</a></p>
    <p>Lalit Maganti's <a href="https://github.com/LalitMaganti/syntaqlite">syntaqlite</a> is currently being discussed <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47648828">on Hacker News</a> thanks to <a href="https://lalitm.com/post/building-syntaqlite-ai/">Eight years of wanting, three months of building with AI</a>, a deep dive into how it was built.</p>
<p>This inspired me to revisit <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/tree/main/syntaqlite-python-extension#readme">a research project</a> I ran when Lalit first released it a couple of weeks ago, where I tried it out and then compiled it to a WebAssembly wheel so it could run in Pyodide in a browser (the library itself uses C and Rust).</p>
<p>This <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/syntaqlite">new playground</a> loads up the Python library and provides a UI for trying out its different features: formating, parsing into an AST, validating, and tokenizing SQLite SQL queries.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/syntaqlite-playground.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a dark-themed SQL validation playground called SyntaqLite. The "Validate" tab is selected from options including Format, Parse, Validate, and Tokenize. The SQL input contains "SELECT id, name FROM usr WHERE active = 1" with a schema defining "users" and "posts" tables. Example buttons for "Table typo", "Column typo", and "Valid query" are shown above a red "Validate SQL" button. The Diagnostics panel shows an error for unknown table 'usr' with the suggestion "did you mean 'users'?", and the JSON panel displays the corresponding error object with severity, message, and offset fields."></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: not sure how I missed this but <a href="https://playground.syntaqlite.com/#p=sqlite-basic-select">syntaqlite has its own WebAssembly playground</a> linked to from the README.</p>
